# RSNA-Intracranial-Aneurysm-Detection

This project focuses on developing machine learning models to detect and localize intracranial aneurysms across multiple types of brain imaging, including CTA, MRA, T1 post-contrast, and T2-weighted MRI.

Intracranial aneurysms affect nearly 3% of the global population, yet up to 50% are only diagnosed after a rupture—often leading to severe outcomes or death. Each year, they contribute to approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide, with half of the victims under the age of 50.

This work is part of a competition hosted by the RSNA, in collaboration with the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR), the Society of Neurointerventional Surgery (SNIS), and the European Society of Neuroradiology (ESNR).

The dataset includes real-world clinical variation from multiple institutions, scanner types, and imaging protocols, challenging models to generalize across diverse scenarios. The ultimate goal is to build automated tools that support early diagnosis, enabling intervention before rupture occurs, and saving lives.
